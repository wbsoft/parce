- removed get_group_* functions from tree.py, added them as methods to
  GroupToken

2020-06-02: parce-0.13.0

- documentation updates and improvements
- added rule.anyof() and rule.gselect()
- added the @lexicon consume argument, which puts a switching token in the
  target context
- added transform.Items.grouped() and .objects()
- TreeBuilder.replace_pos() now gets the index as second arg, not the slice


2020-05-18: parce-0.12.0

- the built-in CSS parser now uses CssTransform to parse a CSS file instead
  of using the query module
- added Transformer.connect_treebuilder() to keep a transformed result auto-
  matically up-to-date.
- a BackgroundTransformer was added
- the parent attribute of a tree Node now uses a weak reference
- the group attribute of a _GroupToken is not a tuple of _GroupTokens anymore,
  it's just an integer value indicating the index of the token in the group.
  This is done to annihilate circular references.


2020-05-13: parce-0.11.0

- fix NameError: name 'Escape' is not defined in parce/css.py
- in the bundled languages __all__ is defined and from import * is not used

  are simpler, more powerful and fine-grained
- some modules have been renamed:
  action → StandardAction is now in standardaction, ActionItem in ruleitem
  stdactions → action
- the rule item helpers are not in the parce namepace, but in parce.rule

  to any structure you want using a Transform class, potentionally using

  (except for Pattern)
- make it possible to create derived lexicons, e.g. to parse here documents

  str.find instead of re.search.
