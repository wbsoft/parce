ChangeLog
=========


2020-05-04: parce-0.9.0

- initial version of a transform module, that can transform a parce tree
  to any structure you want using a Transform class, potentionally using
  caching on contexts
- added util.Observable, and use it in TreeBuilder to emit events
- added unicharclass module
- added using(), like in Pygments, it lexes a match with another lexicon
- added JavaScript parser
- added Python console session parser (with prompts)
- added basic GNU Texinfo parser
- added groff/troff parser, even includes LilyPond (as per the groff manual!)
- fixed parsing resume when first part of a match was skipped or not used
  (e.g. r'( )(")', bygroup(skip, String) or r' (")', bygroup(String))


2020-04-25: parce-0.8.5

- restructured standard actions, easier to combine actions
- improved default styles, added a template for new CSS styles
- added oldfashioned terminal CSS style (see parce/themes)
- parce is now fully recursion proof, there is no limit on the depth of a tree
- added toml parser
- added tex/latex parser
- added HTML parser, building on the XML parser and supporting CSS
- support \score inside \markup in LilyPond
- added the registry module, and the main find() function
- TreeBuilder.peek(start, tree) now also gets start position
- default_action can now be a dynamic item (TextItem)
- added the main maparg() helper


2020-04-07: parce-0.8.0

- added documentation with examples for bundled languages
- added ini file parser
- added mapmember and mapgroupmember rule items
- tree builder: simpler API, all types now simply use rebuild()
- tree builder: while building new tree, keep old tree intact
- tree builder: now it is possible to get fine-grained updates
- added treebuilder.peek() functionality to get a quick first part of a build


2020-03-14: parce-0.7.0

- bytext() and bymatch() are now generic "replacables", they can be used
  to specify an alternative action, target or both in one go. tomatch() was not
  needed anymore and is gone.
- much more replacables, all replacable items now inherit from DynamicItem,
  (except for Pattern)
- make it possible to create derived lexicons, e.g. to parse here documents
- improved LilyPond and Scheme parser
- added JSON parser
- lexer resurrected, now generates an event stream, which is used by the tree
  builder
- documentation improvements, more examples in doc strings


2020-02-16: parce-0.6.0

- Large improvements in theme module, MetaTheme working well
- MetaTheme can render embedded themes with their own window style
- Added formatter module to format/highlight/colorize text using a Theme
- More queries in query module, and a query evaluates to False when no results
- Smart Context.context_slices method that yields slices of nodes per-context
  for every range. When processing the nodes from each slice we know they
  originated in the same lexicon and language.
- Documentation improvements, better cross-linking


2020-02-07: parce-0.5.0

- Added CSS module to parse and use stylesheets, using CSS lang def
- Added theme module using CSS to assign text formats to standard actions


2020-01-27: parce-0.4.0

- Added testing using pytest
- Added CSS parser
- Improved LilyPond and Scheme parser
- Documentation added and improved
- Running `pytest-3` now also validates all languages


2020-01-22: parce-0.3.0

- Renamed to parce. Better, not a company name and sounds like 'parse'


2020-01-21: livelex-0.3.0

- add query module
- fixed util.merge_adjacent_tokens()
- optimize: when there is only one rule in a lexicon and the pattern does not
  use regexp classes or qualifiers, and there are no dynamic actions or
  targets that depend on a match object; convert it to a string and use
  str.find instead of re.search.


2020-01-15: livelex-0.2.0

- API added to tokenize in background thread
- qtdocument moved to livelex-qt


2020-01-08: livelex-0.1.0

- Moved from pre-alpha to alpha :-)
- Much more documention in code
- Tree construction and partial rebuild very robust now
- Standard actions defined
- add lang/xml.py as a sketch how to implement a language with lexicons
- Full api in livelex.*
- experimental QtDocument, implementing TreeDocument around a QTextDocument
- Improvements in tree navigation and iteration speed
- Nice find/replace methods for AbstractDocument


2020-01-02: livelex-0.0.7

- Lots of new stuff, document, tree structure etc, old lexer gone
- test/validation functions
- Fix missing parentheses around two-character expression, e.g. when creating a
  regexp from ['a', 'abc']


2019-12-18: livelex-0.0.6

- Fix AttributeError: module 'livelex.regex' has no attribute 'RegexBuilder'
