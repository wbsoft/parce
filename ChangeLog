ChangeLog
=========

current:

- added documentation with examples for bundled languages
- added ini file parser


2020-03-14: parce-0.7.0

- bytext() and bymatch() are now generic "replacables", they can be used
  to specify an alternative action, target or both in one go. tomatch() was not
  needed anymore and is gone.
- much more replacables, all replacable items now inherit from DynamicItem,
  (except for Pattern)
- make it possible to create derived lexicons, e.g. to parse here documents
- improved LilyPond and Scheme parser
- added JSON parser
- lexer resurrected, now generates an event stream, which is used by the tree
  builder
- documentation improvements, more examples in doc strings


2020-02-16: parce-0.6.0

- Large improvements in theme module, MetaTheme working well
- MetaTheme can render embedded themes with their own window style
- Added formatter module to format/highlight/colorize text using a Theme
- More queries in query module, and a query evaluates to False when no results
- Smart Context.context_slices method that yields slices of nodes per-context
  for every range. When processing the nodes from each slice we know they
  originated in the same lexicon and language.
- Documentation improvements, better cross-linking


2020-02-07: parce-0.5.0

- Added CSS module to parse and use stylesheets, using CSS lang def
- Added theme module using CSS to assign text formats to standard actions


2020-01-27: parce-0.4.0

- Added testing using pytest
- Added CSS parser
- Improved LilyPond and Scheme parser
- Documentation added and improved
- Running `pytest-3` now also validates all languages


2020-01-22: parce-0.3.0

- Renamed to parce. Better, not a company name and sounds like 'parse'


2020-01-21: livelex-0.3.0

- add query module
- fixed util.merge_adjacent_tokens()
- optimize: when there is only one rule in a lexicon and the pattern does not
  use regexp classes or qualifiers, and there are no dynamic actions or
  targets that depend on a match object; convert it to a string and use
  str.find instead of re.search.

- API added to tokenize in background thread
- qtdocument moved to livelex-qt

- Full api in livelex.*
- experimental QtDocument, implementing TreeDocument around a QTextDocument
- Improvements in tree navigation and iteration speed
- Nice find/replace methods for AbstractDocument


2020-01-02: livelex-0.0.7
