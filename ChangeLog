ChangeLog of the Python parce package
=======================================


2020-01-22: parce-0.3.0

- Renamed to parce. Better, not a company name and sounds like 'parse'


2020-01-21: livelex-0.3.0

- add query module
- fixed util.merge_adjacent_tokens()
- optimize: when there is only one rule in a lexicon and the pattern does not
  use regexp classes or qualifiers, and there are no dynamic actions or
  targets that depend on a match object; convert it to a string and use
  str.find instead of re.search.
