The Document class
==================

*parce* provides a :class:`~parce.Document` which can keep the text, collect
changes to the text and internally call the TreeBuilder to process the changes.
The Document simply behaves as a *mutable string* with some extra features.

To instantiate a Document::

    >>> import parce
    >>> from parce.lang.xml import Xml   # just for example
    >>> d = parce.Document()
    >>> d.set_root_lexicon(Xml.root)
    >>> d.set_text(r'<xml attr="value">')

You can also give root lexicon and text on instantiation::

    >>> d = parce.Document(Xml.root, r'<xml attr="value">')

Or :meth:`~parce.docio.DocumentIOMixin.load` a document from the filesystem::

    >>> d = parce.Document.load("file.xml")

This method can autodetect the language.
To get the tree::

    >>> tree = d.get_root(True)
    >>> tree.dump()
    <Context Xml.root at 0-18 (3 children)>
     ├╴<Token '<' at 0:1 (Delimiter)>
     ├╴<Token 'xml' at 1:4 (Name.Tag)>
     ╰╴<Context Xml.attrs at 5-18 (5 children)>
        ├╴<Token 'attr' at 5:9 (Name.Attribute)>
        ├╴<Token '=' at 9:10 (Delimiter.Operator)>
        ├╴<Token '"' at 10:11 (Literal.String)>
        ├╴<Context Xml.dqstring at 11-17 (2 children)>
        │  ├╴<Token 'value' at 11:16 (Literal.String)>
        │  ╰╴<Token '"' at 16:17 (Literal.String)>
        ╰╴<Token '>' at 17:18 (Delimiter)>


Accessing and modifying text
----------------------------

All text is available through the ``text()`` method, and, just like a Python
string, a fragment of text in the Document can be read using the ``[ ]``
syntax::

    >>> d.text()
    '<xml attr="value">'
    >>> d[5:17]
    'attr="value"'

But you can also modify the text, using the slice syntax::

    >>> d[11:16]="Something Completely Else!!"
    >>> d.text()
    '<xml attr="Something Completely Else!!">'
    >>> d.get_root(True).dump()
    <Context Xml.root at 0-40 (3 children)>
     ├╴<Token '<' at 0:1 (Delimiter)>
     ├╴<Token 'xml' at 1:4 (Name.Tag)>
     ╰╴<Context Xml.attrs at 5-40 (5 children)>
        ├╴<Token 'attr' at 5:9 (Name.Attribute)>
        ├╴<Token '=' at 9:10 (Delimiter.Operator)>
        ├╴<Token '"' at 10:11 (Literal.String)>
        ├╴<Context Xml.dqstring at 11-39 (2 children)>
        │  ├╴<Token 'Something Completely Else!!' at 11:38 (Literal.String)>
        │  ╰╴<Token '"' at 38:39 (Literal.String)>
        ╰╴<Token '>' at 39:40 (Delimiter)>

Note that we requested the tree again (and awaited it being tokenized) using
``get_root(True)``, but the tree returned will always be the same object, for
the lifetime of the Document (or to be more precise, of the TreeBuilder the
document internally uses).

Using ``Document.modified_range()`` we get information about the part that
was retokenized since the last change::

    >>> d.modified_range()
    (11, 38)

This information is provided by the TreeBuilder. Using
``Document.open_lexicons()`` we can get the list of lexicons that the
TreeBuilder found to be left open by the document::

    >>> d.open_lexicons()
    [Xml.tag]

In this case, because the xml tag was not closed, an ``Xml.tag`` context was
left open. We can change that. Using ``Document.insert()`` we add one
character::

    >>> d.insert(39, '/')
    >>> d.open_lexicons()
    []
    >>> d.get_root().last_token()
    <Token '/>' at 39:41 (Delimiter)>
    >>> d.modified_range()
    (39, 41)

Instead of ``insert()``, we could also have written ``d[39:39]='/'``.


Performing multiple edits in once
---------------------------------

When you want to perform multiple edits in one go, start a :python:ref:`with
<with>` context and apply all desired changes. The document does not change
during these edits, so all ranges remain valid during the process.

Only when the ``with`` block is exited, the changes are applied and the tree
of tokens is updated::

    >>> from parce.action import Name
    >>> with d:
    ...     for token in d.get_root().query.all.action(Name.Tag):
    ...         d[token.pos:token.end] = "yo:" + token.text.upper()
    ...
    >>> d.text()
    '<yo:XML attr="Something Completely Else!!"/>'

This incantation replaces all XML tag names with the same name in upper case
and with ``"yo:"`` prepended.

When editing a document in a ``with`` context, it is an error if your changes
overlap. Because it is then not clear how the text would look like after
applying the changes. For example::

    >>> d = parce.Document(Xml.root, r'<xml attr="value">')
    >>> with d:
    ...     d[1:4] = 'XML'
    ...     d[5:9] = 'attribute'
    ...     d[6:16] = 'blabla'
    ...
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 4, in <module>
      (...)
    RuntimeError: overlapping changes: 6 before 9; text='blabla'

When inserting multiple pieces on the same position, the order in which the
changes are applied is always respected::

    >>> d = parce.Document(Xml.root, r'<xml attr="value">')
    >>> with d:
    ...     d[16:16] = ' value1'
    ...     d[16:16] = ' value2'
    ...     d[16:16] = ' value3'
    ...
    >>> d.text()
    '<xml attr="value value1 value2 value3">'


Cursor and Block
----------------

Related to Document are :class:`~parce.document.Cursor` and
:class:`~parce.document.Block`.

A Cursor simply describes a position (``pos``) in the document, or a selected
range (from ``pos`` to ``end``). If you write routines that inspect the tokens
and then change the text in some way, you can write them so that they expect
the cursor as argument, so they get the cursor's Document, the selected range
and the tokenized tree in one go.

A cursor keeps its position updated as the Document changes, as long as you
keep a reference to it.

A Block describes a line of text and is instantiated using
:meth:`Document.find_block() <parce.document.AbstractDocument.find_block>`,
:meth:`Document.blocks() <parce.document.AbstractDocument.blocks>`,
:meth:`Cursor.block() <parce.document.Cursor.block>` or
:meth:`Cursor.blocks() <parce.document.Cursor.blocks>`,
and then knows its ``pos`` and ``end`` in the Document. You can easily iterate
over lines of text using the ``blocks()`` methods.


Getting at the tokens
---------------------

Of course, you can get to the tokens by examining the tree, but there are a few
convenience methods. :meth:`Document.token(pos)
<parce.work.WorkerDocumentMixin.token>` returns the token closest at the
specified position (and on the same line), and :meth:`Cursor.token()
<parce.document.AbstractTextRange.token>` does the same. :meth:`Cursor.tokens()
<parce.document.AbstractTextRange.tokens>` yields the tokens in the selected
range, if any.

:meth:`Block.tokens() <parce.document.Block.tokens>` returns a tuple of the
tokens at that line::

    >>> from parce import Document
    >>> from parce.lang.css import Css
    >>> d = Document(Css.root, open('parce/themes/default.css').read())
    >>> b = d.find_block(200)
    >>> b.tokens()
    (<Token 'background' at 203:213 (Name.Property.Definition)>, <Token ':' at 213:214 (Delimiter)>,
    <Token 'ivory' at 215:220 (Literal.Color)>, <Token ';' at 220:221 (Delimiter)>)


Maintaining a transformation
----------------------------

Behind the scenes of Document, a :class:`~parce.work.Worker` is responsible for
updating the tokenized tree (i.e. running the tree builder), but this same
worker can also update the transformed result of the tokenized tree.

To enable this, all that's needed is to add a Transformer to the document's
Worker. You can specify a Transformer (and/or a Worker) on Document
construction. Here is an example::

    >>> from parce.lang.json import Json
    >>> from parce import Document
    >>> from parce.transform import Transformer
    >>> d = Document(Json.root, transformer=Transformer())
    >>> d.set_text('{"key": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}')
    >>> d.get_transform(True)
    {'key': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
    >>> d.insert(22, ", 6, 7, 8")
    >>> d.get_transform(True)
    {'key': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]}

Note that after inserting some text the transformed result automatically gets
updated. If all you need is simply the default transformer, construction of
a document is even simpler::

    >>> import parce
    >>> d = parce.Document(parce.find('json'), '{"key": [1, 2, 3]}', transformer=True)
    >>> d.get_transform(True)
    {'key': [1, 2, 3]}


More goodies
------------

The :class:`parce.Document` class is in fact built from four base classes:
:class:`~parce.mutablestring.AbstractMutableString`/:class:`~parce.mutablestring.MutableString`
from the :mod:`~parce.mutablestring` module,
:class:`~parce.document.AbstractDocument`/:class:`~parce.document.Document`
from the :mod:`~parce.document` module,
:class:`~parce.docio.DocumentIOMixin` from the
:mod:`~parce.docio` module and
:class:`~parce.work.WorkerDocumentMixin` from the
:mod:`~parce.work` module.

Using :class:`parce.DocumentInterface` (which bundles all those base classes),
it is not difficult to design a class that wraps an object representing a text
document in a GUI editor. You need only to provide two methods in your wrapper:
:meth:`~parce.mutablestring.AbstractMutableString.text` to get all text, and
:meth:`~parce.mutablestring.AbstractMutableString._update_text` to change the
text programmatically. When the text is changed,
:class:`~parce.document.AbstractDocument` calls
:meth:`~parce.mutablestring.AbstractMutableString.text_changed`, which in
:class:`~parce.work.WorkerDocumentMixin` is implemented to inform the
TreeBuilder about a part of text that needs to be retokenized. Also your
wrapper class should call
:meth:`~parce.mutablestring.AbstractMutableString.text_changed` whenever the
user has typed in the editor.

Because a Document *is* basically a mutable string, we added some more nice
methods to perform certain actions like search, replace, and substitution using
regular expressions. And even undo/redo! See the :doc:`document module's
documentation <document>`.
