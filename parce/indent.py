This module provides Indenter to indent a Document.

To use the :class:`Indenter`: instantiate one and call its
:meth:`~AbstractIndenter.indent` method with a :class:`~parce.Cursor`
describing the text range to indent. For example::

    >>> from parce import Document, Cursor
    >>> from parce.indent import Indenter
    >>> from parce.lang.css import Css
    >>> i = Indenter()
    >>> i.indent_string = "    " # use four spaces by default
    >>> d = Document(Css.root, "h1 {\ncolor: red;\n     }\n")
    >>> c = Cursor(d).select_all()
    >>> i.indent(c)
    >>> d.text()
    'h1 {\n    color: red;\n}\n'

Indenter uses per-language Indent classes which define the indenting behaviour.
You can add them manually to Indenter, but it can also find Indent classes
automatically by looking in the language's module and finding there an Indent
subclass with the same name, with "Indent" appended.

To further adapt the indenting behaviour, you can implement the
:meth:`~AbstractIndenter.indent_events` method of the Indenter. Or the
:meth:`Indent.indent_events` method of the language-specific indenter.

The following events can be yielded (simply module constants):

``BLANK``:
    this is a blank line, the current indent level is not changed.

``CURRENT_INDENT, string``:
    the current indent string this line has.

``INDENT``
    next line should be indented a level.

``NO_INDENT``:
    the indent of this line may not be changed at all, e.g. because it is part
    of a multiline string.

``DEDENT``:
    next line should be dedented a level. (If this event occurs before
    ``INDENT`` or ``NO_DEDENT``, the current line can be dedented.)

``NO_DEDENT``:
    further ``DEDENT`` events will not dedent the current line anymore, but
    rather affect the indentation of the next line.

``PREFER_INDENT``, ``string``:
    use this indent for the current line, but do not change the indent level or
    the current indent for the next line.

``NO_STRIP``:
    trailing whitespace should not be stripped off this line.

``ALIGN``, ``string``:
    The last ``INDENT`` event should use the specified string for alignment
    instead of the default indent (relatively to the start of the text in the
    current line excluding the current indent).
