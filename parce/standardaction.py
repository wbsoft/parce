This module defines StandardAction.

A StandardAction is a singleton object. Instantiate a StandardAction with a
string name. The same name actually returns the same object::

    >>> from parce.standardaction import StandardAction
    >>> StandardAction('test') is StandardAction('test')
    True

A StandardAction stores its name in the ``_name`` attribute. Accessing any
attribute (*without underscore*) creates that attribute as a new instance, with
the current instance in the ``_parent`` attribute::

    >>> Name = StandardAction('Name')
    >>> Name.Function is Name.Function
    True
    >>> Name.Function._parent
    Name

This way a new action type can be created that shares its parent with other
types, a concept borrowed from pygments. An example::

    >>> Comment = StandardAction("Comment")
    >>> Literal = StandardAction("Literal")
    >>> String = Literal.String
    >>> String.DoubleQuotedString
    Literal.String.DoubleQuotedString
    >>> String.SingleQuotedString
    Literal.String.SingleQuotedString

StandardAction instances support iteration and membership methods.
Iteration yields the instance ifself and then the parents::

    >>> for i in String.DoubleQuoted:
    ...     print(i)
    ...
    Literal.String.DoubleQuoted
    Literal.String
    Literal

And the :keyword:`in` operator returns True when a standard action belongs to
another one, i.e. the other one is one of the ancestors of the current action::

    >>> String.DoubleQuotedString in String
    True
    >>> Literal in String
    False

The :keyword:`in` operator also works with a string::

    >>> 'String' in Literal.String.DoubleQuoted
    True
    >>> 'Literal' in String
    True

The last one could be surprising, but String is defined as ``Literal.String``::

    >>> String
    Literal.String

Finally, the `&` operator returns the common ancestor, if any::

    >>> String & Number
    Literal
    >>> String & Text
    >>>

See for the full list of pre-defined standard actions :doc:`stdactions`.
