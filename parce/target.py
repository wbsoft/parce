"""
A Target describes where to go.

In a lexicon rule, you can specify destinations using integers or lexicons.
A Target generalizes this in two values/attributes: ``pop`` and ``push``.

``pop`` is zero or a negative integer, determining how many lexicons to
pop off the current state/context.

``push`` is a list of zero or more lexicons, determining which lexicons to
add to the current state.

You can sort of "add" targets using a TargetFactory, which can create single
Target objects combining multiple targets in once.
