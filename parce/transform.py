Transform c.q. evaluate a tree or a stream of events.

This module provides the Transformer that does the work, the Transform base
class for all your transforming classes, the Item that wraps the output of
sub-contexts, the Items list type to ease iterating over the contents of a
context, and some toplevel convenience functions.

See also the documentation: :doc:`transforming`.

TODO: it would be nice to be able to specify the Transform for another Language
inside a Transform, just like a lexicon can target a lexicon from a different
language. But I'm not yet sure how it would be specified.
