class Dispatcher:
    """Dispatches calls via an instance to methods based on the first argument.

    A Dispatcher is used as a decorator when defining a class, and then called
    via or in an instance to select a method based on the first argument (which
    must be hashable).

    If you override methods in a subclass that were dispatched, the
    dispatcher automatically dispatches to the new method. If you want to add
    new keywords in a subclass, just create a new Dispatcher with the same
    name. It will automatically inherit the references stored in the old
    dispatcher.

    Usage::

        class MyClass:
            dispatch = Dispatcher()

            @dispatch(1)
            def call_one(self, value):
                print("One called", value)

            @dispatch(2)
            def call_two(self, value):
                print("Two called", value)

            def handle_input(self, number, value):
                self.dispatch(number, value)

        >>> i = MyClass()
        >>> i.handle_input(2, 3)
        Two called 3

    Values of the first argument that are not handled are normally silently
    ignored, but you can also specify a default function, that is called when
    a value is not handled::

        class MyClass:
            @Dispatcher
            def dispatch(self, number, value):
                print("Default function called:", number, value)

            @dispatch(1)
            def call_one(self, value):
                print("One called", value)

            @dispatch(2)
            def call_two(self, value):
                print("Two called", value)

            def handle_input(self, number, value):
                self.dispatch(number, value)

        >>> i = MyClass()
        >>> i.handle_input(3, 10)
        Default function called: 3 10

    To get the method for a key without calling it directly, e.g. to see of
    a method exists for a key, use::

        >>> meth = i.dispatch.get(1)   # returns a bound method
        >>> if meth:
        ...     meth("hi there")
        ...
        One called hi there

    If you specified a default method on creation of the dispatcher, that
    method is also accessible, in the ``default`` attribute::

        >>> i.dispatch.default(1, 2)
        Default function called: 1 2

    Use :meth:`connect` to add a callable to be called when a certain event
    occurs.

    To announce an event from inside methods, use :meth:`emit`. In your
    documentation you should specify *which* arguments are used for *which*
    events; in order to keep this class simple and fast, no checking is
    performed whatsoever.

    Example::

        >>> o = Observable()
        >>>
        >>> def slot(arg):
        ...     print("slot called:", arg)

        >>>
        >>> o.emit('test', 1)   # in a method of your Observable subclass
        slot called: 1

    Is is also possible to use :meth:`emit` in a :python:ref:`with <with>`
    context. In that case the return values of the connected functions are
    collected and if they are a context manager, they are entered as well. An
    example::

        >>> import contextlib
        >>>
        >>> @contextlib.contextmanager
        ... def f():
        ...     print("one")
        ...     yield
        ...     print("two")
        ...
        >>> o=Observable()
        >>> o.connect('test', f)
        >>>
        >>> with o.emit('test'):
        ...     print("Yo!!!")
        ...
        one
        Yo!!!
        two

    This enables you to announce events, and connected objects can perform a
    task before the event's context starts and another task when the event's
    context exits.
