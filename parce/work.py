"""
This module defines the :class:`Worker` class.

A Worker is designed to run a TreeBuilder and a Transformer as soon as source
text is updated. It is possible to run those jobs in a background thread.

The whole process is divided in certain stages, and performed by exhausting the
:meth:`Worker.process` generator fully.

The Worker is intended to be used as the compagnon for the
:class:`~parce.Document` class and cause the TreeBuilder and (if set) the
Transformer to do their jobs in a configurable and flexible manner.

It is possible to wait for the parce tree of the transform result, or to
arrange for a callback to be called when the work is done. As Worker inherits
:class:`~.util.Observable`, you can connect to its events to get notified when
a tree or transform is updated.

Inherit of Worker to implement other features or another way to use a
background thread for (parts of) the job.

    Call :meth:`update` to re-run the treebuilder on changed text, or new text,
