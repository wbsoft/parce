"""
This module defines the :class:`Worker` class.

A Worker is designed to run a TreeBuilder and a Transformer as soon as source
text is updated. It is possible to run those jobs in a background thread,
completely or partially.

The whole process is divided in certain stages, performed by exhausting the
:meth:`Worker.process` generator fully.

The Worker is intended to be used as the compagnon for the
:class:`~parce.Document` class and cause the TreeBuilder and (if set) the
Transformer to do their jobs in a configurable and flexible manner.

It is possible to wait for the parce tree of the transform result, or to
arrange for a callback to be called when the work is done.

Inherit Worker to implement other features or another way to use a background
thread for (parts of) the job.
